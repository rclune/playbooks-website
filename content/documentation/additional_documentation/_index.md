Every project is unique, and so are its documentation needs. You may find that your users or contributors require information that falls outside the scope of this Playbook.

When creating additional documentation, use the sections of this Playbook and the templates in the companion repository <!-- TODO: link to companion repo --> as a foundation. Choose the examples that most closely match what you want to write, and adapt them to suit your project’s context. It’s also helpful to review well-written examples from other projects for structure and tone. For further inspiration and templates, the [Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template) offers excellent resources for developing clear, consistent, and user-friendly documentation.
