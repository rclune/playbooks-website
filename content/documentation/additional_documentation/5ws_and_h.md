title: Additional Documentation Fundamentals
what: > 
  This is an open-ended category for any other documentation that users may find helpful. It can include explanations of output files produced by the tool, justifications for key software design decisions, or any other supporting information that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into tutorials or reference materials. 
why: >
  Providing this information helps users understand the tool more deeply and offers context that might be too detailed for tutorials or reference guides. It can also improve transparency around design and implementation choices.
when: >
   **Mid-Development**
   
   These explanations should be written as development progresses, as they can serve as internal documentation for developers to record major decisions. Once the tool is ready for publication, you can decide which portions to edit and include in the user-facing documentation.
where: 
    Included as part of the external documentation. 
importance: Low
