The overview is an expansion of the [Project Overview](../readme/overview.md) section in your README. It can go into more detail about what your tool does and how, why people should be interested in it, resources you would like to highlight, etc. If, however, you think the summary of your project that you included in your README is enough, a separate overview is not necessary. 

The companion template repository includes both the README and an overview in the homepage of the external documentation. See the instructions in `docs/index.md` for what to do if you do or do not have a separate overview.md file. 

This section discusses: 
* What you should include in your Overview
* Writing tips to help guide your process for creating this piece of documentation

Remember that a Markdown template for the Overview is available in the companion template repository! <!-- TODO: link template repository -->
