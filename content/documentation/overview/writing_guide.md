title: Writing an Overview
weight: 2

Included here are the questions that you will also find in the overview.md template in the companion repo for this playbook. Here, we've expanded on these questions to give you more to explore when you're thinking about what to include in your overview. Not every question will be 
relevant for your project, and there maybe other information you would like to include in your overview that is not mentioned here. 

>*Writing Tip:* If you get stuck, try describing your project to a friend/colleague who is a fairly good representation of a user of your tool. 
> What would you say? What questions do they have as you're explaining it?
