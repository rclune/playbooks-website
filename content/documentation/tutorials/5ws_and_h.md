title: Tutorial Fundamentals
what: > 
  Step-by-step instructions with brief explanations that guide a **new or beginner** user to a deliverable and familiarize them with the usage of your tool.
why: >
  A good starting tutorial can help users feel empowered to use your tool. Tutorials can also act as a way to show off different capabilities of your tool to new users. 
when: >
  **Finalizing for Release and Publication**  
  
  
  While you can think about the subject of the tutorials you want to include with your tool earlier in the development process, you want to wait until the capabilities, API, etc. of your tool are stable to write your tutorials. This avoids having to rewrite it every time the inputs of a function changes during development.  
where: In the external documentation, it should be pointed to in the README as a place to start once a new user has installed the tool.
