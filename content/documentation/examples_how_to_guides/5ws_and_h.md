title: Example/How-To Guide Fundamentals
what: > 
  Examples of other aspects of the tool not covered by the introductory tutorial or any other additional tutorials. The user looking at these tutorials has some experience with the tool but wants to know how to perform specific tasks.
why: >
  These examples can act as a quick way for intermediate/advanced users to see how to do specific tasks without having to read an entire tutorial. These can also easily show off some of the capabilities of your tool not explicitly covered in a tutorial. 
when: >
  **Mid Development**  
  
  
  These examples/guides should be generated during the development process as they can also act as tests for different aspects of your tool. As features are added to your tool, the examples for how to utilize those features can be added as well.
where: 
    In a separate page (or pages) in the external documentation. If they are runnable scripts, they should be in an easy-to-find `examples` directory in your repository as well.
