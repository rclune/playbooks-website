what: > 
  Instructions for how code and documentation contributors can appropriately suggest changes to the project, write bug reports, and interact with other members of the community.
why: >
  Developers of **all experience levels** need to know your expectations for what to include in a pull request, bug report, code review, etc. to know that they are productively contributing to a project. A Contributing Guide also helps ensure that there is a positive, collaborative environment surrounding your tool. 
when: >
  **Finalizing for Release and Publication**  
  
  
  The code style, pull request expectations, etc. can evolve while working on your project. To avoid rewriting this guide multiple times, writing it can wait until you are ready to make your project public. 
where: 
    This file should go in the main directory of your repository and included in your external documentation, similar to your README and LICENSE files.
