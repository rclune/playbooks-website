Where should people go to ask questions, learn more, and get help? 

The answer to this question might include: 
- The GitHub Issues page for your repository
- The GitHub Discussions page for your repository
- Messaging platforms like Slack or Discord
- Links to the external documentation
- Email addresses for the main, active developers

If there are multiple places users can go for help make sure to provide some information on which resource is better for different situations. For example, you may want to have GitHub Issues be a place only for clear issues with the code while GitHub Discussions should be the place users go to for information about tool usage, code style/documentation questions, etc.
