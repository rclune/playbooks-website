title: Getting Started with Your README

If you would like to use the documentation infrastruture already set up in the companion GitHub repo, you can find a template for the README here. <!--TODO:LINK TO REPO ONCE IT'S PUBLIC--> This process guide expands on that template to ask leading questions, give you food for thought, and to help you get started on difficult sections. 

Your README is in some ways a combination of several of the other types of documentation discussed in this playbook. For example, the overview section in the README will be a summary of what would go in an 'Overview' page in the actual documentation. <!-- TODO: LINK TO EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION --> 

There are two main questions you are trying to answer with your README, while keeping it as short as possible: 
- **Why** would a user want to use my tool?
- **How** does a user use this tool? 
All extraneous information outside of this needs to go into the external documentation.

It’s good practice to have a new user go through your README and test everything before your repo is made public.
> *Writing tip:* If you need volunteers, offer to exchange your time for theirs. They might need someone to test their own code, review something they’ve written, etc.
