Here's some ideas for what the overview section of your README should contain: 

*(Optional)* **Image that you will use for your graphical abstract:** 
Adding an image can showcase your tool and make it easier for a new user to understand its purpose. If your tool has resulted in a publication, a good image for the graphical abstract may have already been created!

**1â€“2 sentence description of what your software does:**
This is the elevator pitch for your tool! 
>*Writing Tip:* If someone asked you what your tool did in a conversation how would you respond? Imagining that conversation might be a good place to start.

**Publications and How to Cite:**
It's good to include any publications related to your project and/or how to cite your project early on in your README. This is information users and contributors to the software will keep referencing as they use your tool. How you format this information is your choice. For an example of a Citation section in a README see the [AtomWorks project](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks/#citation).

**Point to the External Documentation**
Provide a link to the external docmentation, wherever it is being hosted! It is good to have this link early in your README for visibility.
