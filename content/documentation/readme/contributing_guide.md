If you want community members to contribute PR's, close issues, and help build up the documentation it is important to include contributor's guides. This section in your README may just point to a longer guide in the external documentation if you have a lot to say <!-- TODO link to contributors guide -->

Here's a few pieces of information you may want to include in your README:
- Who can contribute to the code? 
- Who can contribute to the documentation? 
- What is the preferred process for contributing to the code?
- What is the procedure for contributing to the documentation?
    - *Note:* There may be certain dependencies documentation contributors will need to have installed that are not necessary for installing the actual tool. Make sure to note them here or in the external contributors guide.
- Are there any rules or guidelines developers need to follow? For example, the [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). 
- Are there any rules or guidelines documentation contributors need to follow? For example, [Microsoft's Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).
