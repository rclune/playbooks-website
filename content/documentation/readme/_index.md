READMEs are ubiquitous in software development projects, but what should go in them? Too little information and your users and developers won't know what to do with your project. Too much information and people will get lost trying to find the piece of information they need. 

This section discusses:
* What should go into a README vs. the external documentation
* Tips and suggestions for creating a README that is useful for people just discovering the project and long-time users
* An expanded template to help guide your writing process - remember that Markdown templates are available in the companion template repository! <!-- TODO: link template repository -->
