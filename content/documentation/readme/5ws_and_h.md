title: README fundamentals
what: >
  The README is your project's welcome mat. It should clearly explain – for both **new and returning users** – what your tool does, how to install and use it, and where to go for more information or support. 
why: >
  The README is often the first document people read when discovering your tool. A clear, well-organized README helps users quickly understand its purpose and encourages them to engage with and use your project. Without one, users are far less likely to explore further.
when: >
    **Early Development**

    
    Your README should be created early in development and updated regularly as the project evolves. Developers will rely on it throughout the development process for setup instructions, usage notes, and context about the tool.
