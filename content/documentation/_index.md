The OMSF Documentation Playbook intends to lower the barrier for developers to incorporate documentation into their projects from the start. From guides for what documentation is most useful to have for both developers and users of a project to a GitHub repository that has all you need to have automatically written API documentation already set up, this playbook will help ensure that your projects are user- and contributor-friendly. 

## Audience
While the types of documentation and how to approach writing them is applicable to all projects in all coding languages, the OMSF_docs_template repository assumes a Python project and many of the examples given in the text are from Python projects. 

This playbook also assumes the reader has some knowledge of Git and GitHub functionalities. 

## How to Use This Playbook
The Playbook is organized by the type of documentation. Each section will describe the specific piece of documentation in increasing detail with writing tips interspersed throughout. Note that the types of documentation discussed here are just what the authors recommend to have for open source software projects, especially open source scientific software projects. Some items might not be applicable to your project or your project might need documentation not explicitly mentioned. 

There is a companion GitHub repository for this Playbook! <!--TODO LINK THE REPO ONCE I’VE MADE IT PUBLIC-->. It contains:
- A starting setup for using Sphinx to generate the static HTML pages that will make up your external documentation that you can copy into your own project or copy into a new repo for a new project.
- Template markdown files that can be filled out and used in the external documentation for your project.
- Already set-up infrastructure for automatically generating API documentation for your modules and submodules.
- Information for how to host your external documentation on Read the Docs or GitHub Pages.

The types of documentation highlighted in this playbook was in part inspired by the The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation, which is described in detail in this [DIVIO blog post](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/).
