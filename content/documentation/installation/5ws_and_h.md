title: Installation Guide Fundamentals
what: > 
  Step-by-step instructions for how a **new user** can install/download/set up your tool with any hardware limitations or software prerequisites explicitly stated. If a container (e.g. a Docker image) exists, instructions for how to obtain and use the container should be included here too. 
why: >
  Without clear instructions for how to get your tool running on a userâ€™s computing resources, a potential user is much less likely to use your tool or will grow frustrated by the roadblocks they encounter when trying to get started. 
when: >
  **Early or Mid Development**  
  
  
  Throughout development dependencies will likely be added and removed as the software is re-worked. Having an installation guide during this time can help track these dependencies. 
where: In a separate page (or pages) in the external documentation
